                <p>The best ideas can change who we are. urBlog is where those ideas take shape, take off, and spark
                    powerful conversations.
                    We’re an open platform where over 100 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking.
                    Here, expert and undiscovered voices alike dive into the heart of any topic and bring new ideas to
                    the surface.
                    Our purpose is to spread these ideas and deepen understanding of the world.</p>

                <p> We’re creating a new model for digital publishing. One that supports nuance, complexity,
                    and vital storytelling without giving in to the incentives of advertising.
                    It’s an environment that’s open to everyone but promotes substance and authenticity.
                    And it’s where deeper connections forged between readers and writers can lead to discovery and
                    growth.
                    Together with millions of collaborators, we’re building a trusted and vibrant
                    ecosystem fueled by important ideas and the people who think about them.</p>
